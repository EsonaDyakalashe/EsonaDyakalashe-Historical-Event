                        <p>Nelson Mandela was a social rights activist, 
                            politician and philanthropist who became 
                            South Africa’s first Black president from
                             1994 to 1999. After becoming involved in 
                            the anti-apartheid movement in his 20s, 
                            Mandela joined the African National 
                            Congress in 1942. For 20 years, he directed
                             a campaign of peaceful, nonviolent 
                            defiance against the South African government 
                            and its racist policies</p>

                    <h2>Political<br>Prisoner</h2><br>
                    <p>In 1962 Mandela was again arrested, this time for leaving South Africa illegally and for
                        inciting strikes. He was sentenced to five years in jail. The following year he was tried 
                        with other leaders of Umkhonto weSizwe on a charge of high treason, following a 
                        government raid of the group's secret headquarters. Mandela was given a life sentence, 
                        which is in South Africa's Robben  Island. 
                        During the twenty-seven years that Mandela spent in prison, his example of quiet suffering was
                         just one of many pressures on South Africa's apartheid government.
                        Public discussion of Mandela was illegal, and he was allowed few visitors. But as the
                        years dragged on, he was increasingly viewed as a one who suffers for a cause
                        in South Africa and around the worldagainst apartheid.  In 1988 Mandela was hospitalized wwith an illness, and after his 
                        recovery he was returned to prison under somewhat less harsh conditions. By this time,
                      the situation within South Africa was becoming desperate for the ruling white powers. Protest had spread, and 
                        international pressures for the end of apartheid were increasing.South  Africa was isolated as a racist state.
                         It was against this backdrop that F. W. de Klerk (1936–), the president of South Africa, finally responded to 
                         the calls from around the world to release.</p>
